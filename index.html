                The cloudberry is a low growing, perennial herb in the raspberry family. It grows on moist soils and is known for it's fiery yellow fruit of the same name, each fruit is initially pale red, ripening into an amber color in early autumn.
                The fruit is rich in vitamin C. It grows between 10 and barely 30 centimeters high. Despite great demand as a delicacy (particularly in Sweden, Norway and Finland) the cloudberry is not widely cultivated and is primarily a wild plant. The cloudberries are mainly used to make jam, but also liquor and the leaves for tea.
