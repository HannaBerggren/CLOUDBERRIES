## User Experience and Design
---

- Overarching design and Colourscheme

  - I picked my designs/color schemes from the cloudberry frontpage, this felt most appropriate to make a nice structure throughout the page.
  - Sign up for our newsletter was colored to make it stand out a bit against the rest of the page, maybe it makes curious users want to fill out the form to get updated information every now and then.

### Colours

  - I been trying to get good visibility using the contrast of the different colors so that the visually impaired can easily see everything that is written.
  - I have also tried to make my page look happy by mixing the colors from my palette in a tasteful way.
  
  ![colors](./assets/css/images/colors.png "colors")

  I did my colorscheme in https://coolors.co/

  ### Fonts

  - All my fonts are Nanum gothic, Arial;

  ### Content 

- The text for the Home page was taken from Wikipedia with the search of "Cloudberries" and "Health".
- Information of the cloudberries was taken from two different pages.

(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubus_chamaemorus) 
(https://thebarentsobserver.com/en/arctic/2017/08/all-you-didnt-know-about-cloudberry-healthy-gold-arctic)

- The icons in the footer were taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

### The links to my icons if the user wants to read more on different pages about cloudberries:

- https://www.facebook.com/ <br>
- https://www.youtube.com/ <br>
- https://www.instagram.com/ <br>

### Media

- The photos used on the home and about page was taken from Google.

### Wireframes

- Wireframes were created for mobile and desktop.
- to get an overview of how the page will look when it is finished.

![wireframes 2](./assets/css/images/wireframes2.png "wireframes 2")

### Missings links

- The submit button links you back to the homepage, since the right direction doesen't exist today.

### Features Left to Implement

- Another feature idea is to make a schedule of where the viewers can meet in the world to meet up and pick the berries together. To add more pictures of the recipe side and add icons to make the page more appealing, for example so you can easily see how many people the recipe is for.


## Testing 

- I used lighthouse test at https://web.dev/measure and came up with the following scores:
- The resault can be found here: (https://web.dev/measure/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhannaberggren.github.io%2FCLOUDBERRIES%2F)

### Validator Testing 
- <a href = "https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=+https%3A%2F%2Fhannaberggren.github.io%2FCLOUDBERRIES%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=sv">Jigsaw Validator results</a>
 - <a href = "https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fhannaberggren.github.io%2FCLOUDBERRIES%2F">W3C validator results</a> 

### Fixed Bugs
- I fixed two errors in validator.w3 "No p element in scope and p end tag seen". I just removed that.
 The second error was "Stray end tag div". All I had to do was to remove the space between my h2 and h3 heading.

## Deployment 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
